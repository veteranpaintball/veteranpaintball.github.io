        <h3>King of the Hill</h3>
            <p>King of the Hill in paintball is a game mode where teams or individuals compete to control a designated area called the "hill." Players start at their bases and must reach the hill to establish control. The first player to enter the hill becomes the "King" and defends it against opponents. Other players try to eliminate the King and take control for themselves. The game continues as teams battle for control, using tactics and teamwork to gain an advantage. Eliminated players must leave the game temporarily. The team or player who holds the hill the longest wins the game.</p>
